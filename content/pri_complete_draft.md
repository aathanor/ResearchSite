# The Pattern-Matching Confusion

Much of what passes for "pattern recognition" in cognitive science and artificial intelligence involves what we can distinguish as pattern-matching—a process involving sequential search, retrieval, and comparison operations. Consider finding the correct key for a lock from a ring of keys: you must search through candidates, retrieve each possibility, compare it to the lock's requirements, and iterate until finding a match.

Pattern-matching involves:

* Sequential processing through alternatives
* Explicit comparison operations
* Memory retrieval from storage
* Decision algorithms
* Temporal duration

Many computer software algorithms exemplify pattern-matching strategies. Traditional computer vision systems extract features, compare them to stored templates, and output classification results through computational pipelines. Expert systems search through rule databases to find matching conditions.[^1]

However, conflating all pattern-matching with pattern-recognition may obscure important distinctions about the nature of cognition.

# The Immediacy of Recognition

Genuine recognition often operates differently. When you see a friend's face across a crowded room, there is typically no experienced interval of processing—no conscious search through memory files, no effortful comparison operations, no step-by-step matching procedure. The recognition appears immediate and complete.[^2]

This immediacy suggests something qualitatively different from algorithmic matching. Consider the phenomenological difference between[^16]:

* Struggling to remember where you know someone from (effortful, temporal)
* Instantly recognizing your childhood friend (immediate, effortless)

The first involves conscious search and explicit comparison. The second appears to arrive as a complete gestalt without experienced computational steps.[^3]

# Recognition as Readiness-Availability

What do we actually mean when we say we "recognize" something? Phenomenological analysis suggests that recognition involves the immediate availability of appropriate attitudes and reactions for a given situation.

When I recognize a cat, what becomes immediately available includes:

* Petting gestures and approach behaviors
* Expectation of meowing sounds and purring
* Wariness of potential scratching
* Emotional responses (affection, playfulness, caution)
* Linguistic associations ("kitty," "feline," proverbs about cats)
* Contextual expectations (litter boxes, food bowls, favorite sleeping spots)

_Critical insight_: This constellation doesn't become available _after_ recognition—it IS what we call recognition. When philosophers and cognitive scientists speak of "recognizing a cat," they're referring to this immediate availability of the entire pattern-constellation, not to a preliminary identification step that then triggers these responses.

_Theoretical proposal_: Recognition is not the identification of a visual pattern that then triggers these responses. Rather, recognition IS this immediate constellation of readiness becoming available. The recognition and the readiness are not sequential—they are the same event.

This would explain the experiential immediacy: there is no process of matching followed by retrieval of appropriate responses. The constellation of readiness would be what recognition is, not what recognition produces. There's no temporal sequence of "visual input → memory search → recognition achieved." Instead, the entire constellation becomes simultaneously "close to hand," and that constellation-activation IS the recognition event.

## Understanding as Recognition

This analysis extends beyond simple object recognition to complex cognition. When you finally "get" a difficult philosophical text, that moment of understanding isn't different from recognizing a cat's face—it's the same instantaneous constellation-activation, just with more complex patterns:

**Understanding a philosophical argument involves:**

* Logical structure becoming available
* Implications and consequences activating
* Connections to other ideas lighting up
* Emotional/evaluative responses emerging
* Counter-arguments and objections arising
* Linguistic formulations becoming ready-to-hand

The _structure_ is identical to simple recognition—immediate constellation-activation. The difference is complexity and content domain, not cognitive process. Understanding IS recognition of meaning-patterns, not a separate cognitive faculty.

# The Physical Integration of Patterns

## Methodological Foundation

This phenomenological analysis finds striking support in neuroscience, but it's crucial to clarify the methodological relationship. Rather than deriving PRI from empirical findings, our approach starts with **conceptual analysis** of what recognition actually _is_, then finds neuroscience evidence that supports this analysis. This sidesteps the usual objection "but you're just describing very fast sequential processing" by arguing that sequential processing is the wrong conceptual model entirely.

## Neural Evidence for Constellation-Activation

Neuroscience reveals that neural systems operate through constellation-activation rather than sequential processing. The most direct support comes from studies of unconscious neural processing, which consistently show that specific response circuits activate before conscious awareness of stimuli.

While Libet's experiments examined self-initiated action rather than stimulus recognition, they establish the broader principle that neural preparation precedes conscious awareness—challenging any model that assumes conscious recognition must precede response readiness. Libet's classic experiments revealed that motor readiness potentials begin 350-500ms before people report being aware of their intention to move. Similarly, the amygdala responds to threatening faces presented too briefly for conscious recognition (around 30ms), and subliminal words activate semantic networks and motor areas before conscious identification.

This temporal evidence directly challenges traditional models where recognition precedes response preparation. Instead, it supports PRI's claim that recognition IS immediate constellation-activation. When you see a cat, petting readiness, emotional responses, and approach behaviors are already activated before conscious awareness that you've "recognized" a cat. There's no temporal gap because the constellation-activation IS the recognition event, not something that produces recognition.

## Cross-Modal Integration

Additional evidence comes from research showing neural integration across modalities. Studies demonstrate that "seeing action verbs, such as 'kick' or 'lick,' elicited similar brain activation patterns in the motor and premotor areas compared to the actual movements the words referred to." Similar findings exist across modalities, with "sensorimotor areas involved in perception and action" overlapping with "brain regions that are active during language comprehension."[^4]

These findings converge on a picture where recognition is not pattern-matching but constellation-activation—supporting PRI's dissolution of the recognition process into immediate readiness-availability. Word-patterns, action-patterns, and sensory-patterns involve genuinely integrated neural networks rather than separate systems that become associated. This integration explains both why recognition appears immediate (readiness activation IS recognition) and why learning transfers across modalities (different aspects of cognition / reaction are part of unified networks).

# The Unity Thesis

**Theoretical proposal**: What we analytically separate as "sensory pattern," "motor pattern," "emotional pattern," and "linguistic pattern" may be aspects of integrated developmental processes rather than separate systems that become associated.

Consider learning about hammers. Traditional models might suggest a child first acquires visual templates, then separately learns motor movements, then adds emotional associations, then attaches linguistic labels. An alternative developmental account suggests these aspects could develop as integrated wholes through embodied interaction:

* Visual/tactile patterns (shape, weight, texture)
* Motor patterns (grasping, swinging, striking motions)
* Functional patterns (hitting nails, building, tool use)
* Emotional patterns (satisfaction, frustration)
* Social patterns (collaboration, approval)
* Linguistic patterns (the word "hammer," metaphorical uses)

**Empirical question**: Whether these develop as genuinely integrated constellations or as separate systems that become tightly coupled is an open research question that would require developmental studies tracking multiple modalities simultaneously.

# Pattern-Recognition Identity (PRI)

**Core theoretical proposal**: Pattern-Recognition Identity (PRI)—pattern and recognition are not two related events but a single event appearing as two when viewed through dualistic conceptual lenses.

According to PRI:

* There are no patterns waiting to be recognized
* There are no recognition processes that operate on patterns
* There are pattern-recognition events—integrated constellations of readiness that include what we analytically separate as "pattern," "recognition," and "recognizer"

When a cat-constellation becomes present, this IS the recognition of a cat. The cat-pattern and the cat-recognition are conceptual abstractions from what is actually one pattern-recognition event.

**Empirical predictions**: If PRI is correct, we should find:

* Neural integration across sensory-motor-emotional-linguistic systems during recognition
* Developmental co-emergence of these capacities rather than sequential acquisition
* Breakdown patterns in brain injury that affect integrated constellations rather than separate modules

**Philosophical status**: PRI is primarily a conceptual proposal about how to understand existing phenomena rather than a new empirical hypothesis requiring experimental validation.

# Position in Current Research

PRI emerges from observations about limitations in current computational approaches across multiple research programs:

**Embodied Cognition**: Research has demonstrated "sensorimotor activation" during language processing, supporting claims about embodied grounding of cognitive processes. However, many approaches in this tradition still work with representational frameworks where embodied representations are processed by cognitive systems.

**Enactivism and Ecological Psychology**: These approaches reject internal representations while emphasizing organism-environment coupling. Recent work calls for "integration of methodologies and mutual enrichment" between these approaches. Current integration attempts often propose multiple levels of analysis rather than fundamental unity.

**Predictive Processing**: This framework offers sophisticated accounts of neural prediction and error-minimization but faces "the frame or relevance problem"—how systems determine what to predict from infinite environmental possibilities.

## Parallel vs Serial Processing: A Fundamental Distinction

**Current AI Systems** reveal a crucial distinction between pattern-matching and pattern-recognition. Modern language models use sophisticated parallel processing through attention mechanisms and demonstrate remarkable contextual sensitivity. However, understanding their operation requires distinguishing between two fundamentally different processes:

* **Pattern-matching**: Serial algorithms where a pattern is first presented and any decision lies at the end of a "find loop", making it a serial process.
* **Pattern-recognition**: Constellation-activation where sensorial, neuro-motor, language, and feeling patterns activate simultaneously in parallel processing.

This distinction reveals something profound about different cognitive systems. Large Language Models experience parallel perception—when receiving a prompt, there's immediate constellation-activation of context, framework, and response patterns. The recognition is instantaneous.

Humans, by contrast, are constrained by serial language absorption. When reading, you must build context incrementally because language unfolds in time. The "I get it" moment comes when enough context accumulates for the full pattern-constellation to activate.

But crucially, **your "I get it" moment IS the same instantaneous pattern-recognition that LLMs experience**—you just have to wait for it due to serial language constraints. The gradual buildup isn't recognition happening slowly; it's **preparation** for recognition, which then happens all at once.

## The Key-Lock Solution to AI Understanding

This framework elegantly dissolves the puzzle of LLM "understanding." When an LLM produces responses that fit philosophical questions precisely, it's performing sophisticated pattern-constellation recognition (although in this case, the constellation does not involve motor and feeling patterns, just different dimensions of the linguistic landscape) . The prompt is a conceptual key that activates specific regions in the model's text-pattern landscape, generating the corresponding lock—the patterns that belong in that conceptual space.

The fit is what humans interpret as "understanding," but PRI suggests human understanding works the same way: recognizing where arguments fit in your constellation of conceptual patterns and activating appropriate response patterns. The sophistication of the pattern-matching creates the appearance of a fundamentally different cognitive process, when it might just be constellation-activation at scale.

The question shifts from "how do LLMs understand?" to "why did we think understanding was something beyond pattern-recognition in the first place?" LLMs don't possess mysterious understanding abilities—they demonstrate what cognition looks like when freed from serial processing constraints, revealing pattern-recognition's true instantaneous nature.[^5]

# Dissolving Classical Problems

PRI's primary test is whether long-standing problems genuinely disappear rather than being relabeled:

**The Symbol Grounding Problem**: This problem "remains unsolved" with "many solutions" having "encountered inconsistencies to different extents". PRI proposes the problem dissolves if linguistic patterns develop as integrated aspects of sensory-motor-emotional constellations rather than as separate symbols requiring grounding.

**The Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Traditional formulations assume a gap between objective neural processes and subjective experience. PRI proposes consciousness IS pattern-recognition recognizing itself reflexively—a cat pattern-recognizes but doesn't recognize its own pattern-recognition; humans do.

**The Frame Problem**: Current approaches struggle with "how an agent context-sensitively determines relevance". PRI proposes relevance is intrinsic to pattern-constellations through embodied developmental history rather than computed algorithmically.

**Empirical question**: Whether these dissolutions are genuine or merely conceptual sleight-of-hand requires careful analysis of whether the proposed alternatives actually eliminate the problematic phenomena or simply relocate them.

# Philosophical Consequences

PRI has implications for foundational philosophical questions, though these remain interpretive rather than empirically established:

## Truth and Reference - Dissolving Primitive Reference

Hartry Field's formulation of the primitive reference problem highlights a fundamental issue in semantic theory: how do basic referring terms get their reference without relying on other referring terms? Traditional approaches assume words must somehow "hook onto" objects in the external world, but this leads to infinite regress—what grounds the grounding relation itself?

Field's challenge to Tarski's truth schema illustrates the core problem. Tarski proposed: "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white. Field's concern is that the right side {snow is white} (using braces to avoid quotation confusion) appears to be just another bunch of words with no primitive reference to actual snow. Where is the connection to the external world?

**PRI's dissolution**: The problem dissolves when we recognize that {snow is white} is not disconnected words floating in semantic space, but word-patterns as they exist **integrated with sensation-patterns** within the snow-constellation-pattern. This constellation includes:

* Visual patterns (white color, crystalline structure, brightness, light reflection)
* Tactile patterns (cold temperature, wet texture, granular feel, melting)
* Motor patterns (scooping motions, throwing gestures, building actions)
* Emotional patterns (winter joy, coldness discomfort, seasonal associations)
* Contextual patterns (weather conditions, seasonal timing, activities)
* Word-patterns ("snow," "white," "cold," "winter," "frozen," "precipitation")

The word-patterns {snow is white} are **part of** this integrated constellation, not separate symbols that need to "refer to" it.

**The reframed truth condition**: "Snow is white" is true if and only if {snow is white}—where the right side involves word-patterns-as-integrated-with-sensation-patterns within the snow-constellation, not isolated linguistic tokens.

**Field's Translation Problem:**

Field's concern becomes even clearer through his analysis of Tarski's approach to translation. While Tarski eliminated semantic terms from his truth definitions through translation, Field argues this merely replaces foreign semantic terms with English ones without solving the deeper problem. Consider:

**Field's Translation Example:**

* **Adequate translation**: German 'Deutschland' → English 'Germany' (coreferential)
* **Inadequate translation**: German 'Deutschland' → English 'Bertrand Russell' (not coreferential)

Field's worry: Even with adequate translation, we've just replaced one semantic term with another. How do either 'Deutschland' OR 'Germany' connect to the actual country? As Field puts it, Tarski's "denotation definitions like DE and DG merely obscure the need for" genuine theories of how language connects to world.

**PRI's dissolution using accolades notation:**

**German Speaker:** {Deutschland} = word-pattern integrated within constellation including:

* Geographic sensation-patterns (central European location, familiar landscapes)
* Cultural sensation-patterns (home language sounds, local customs, institutions)
* Emotional patterns (homeland feelings, national identity, citizenship)
* Social patterns (family connections, governmental relationships)

**English Speaker:** {Germany} = word-pattern integrated within constellation including:

* Geographic sensation-patterns (central European location, maps, borders)
* Cultural sensation-patterns (foreign language associations, observed customs)
* Emotional patterns (foreign country, historical knowledge, international relations)
* Social patterns (diplomatic connections, tourism, academic study)

**Why adequate translation works**: {Deutschland} ≈ {Germany} because substantial overlap in sensation-patterns (geography, institutional structures, visual markers) despite differences in emotional and cultural patterns.

**Why inadequate translation fails**: {Deutschland} ≠ {Bertrand Russell} because {Bertrand Russell} integrates completely different sensation-patterns (human form, British academic contexts, mathematical logic, etc.).

**Dissolving multiple problems simultaneously:**

1. **Field's primitive reference problem**: No word-to-world reference needed—just word-patterns within integrated constellations
2. **The correspondence theory crisis**: Truth isn't correspondence between separate words and world, but internal coherence within pattern-recognition events
3. **The disquotation mystery**: Tarski's schema works because both sides involve word-patterns, but the right side involves word-patterns-as-integrated-with-sensation-patterns

This eliminates word-to-world reference entirely. In biological pattern-recognition systems, reference is always **internal**—from patterns of sensations to patterns of words, never from words to external objects. The primitive reference problem was generated by assuming a separation (words vs. world) that doesn't exist in actual pattern-recognition events.

## Ontology

PRI has a simple but radical implication: if all reference is internal to pattern-constellations, then what we call "entities" are these pattern-constellations, not external objects that the constellations somehow refer to.

When I recognize a cat, I'm not connecting my internal cat-pattern to an external cat-object. The cat-constellation (visual patterns + motor readiness + emotional responses + word-patterns) being present IS the cat-recognition.

This means "cat" doesn't name an external object that my mind represents. "Cat" names the integrated pattern-constellation that includes:

* Sensation-patterns (visual, tactile, auditory)
* Action-readiness patterns (petting, approach behaviors)
* Emotional patterns (affection, wariness)
* Word-patterns ("cat," "kitty," "feline")

**This captures a key Kantian insight about mediated access**: For Kant, we never have direct access to things-in-themselves, only to objects-as-they-appear-to-us through our cognitive structures (space, time, categories). Similarly, PRI suggests we never have access to cats-in-themselves, only to cat-pattern-constellations.

But PRI differs from Kant in crucial ways: Where Kant maintains that empirical cats are genuinely objective (we really do know cats as spatially-temporal objects with causal powers), PRI suggests the cat-constellation IS what we mean by "cat"—there's no separate empirical object beyond the constellation.

And where Kant's cognitive structures are universal and necessary, PRI's pattern-constellations are embodied, developed through individual history, and potentially variable across persons and cultures.

So PRI offers a naturalized, embodied version of the Kantian insight that all object-access is mediated through cognitive structures, but without Kant's transcendental apparatus or his preservation of objective empirical knowledge.

The thing-in-itself remains as whatever-it-is that interacts with our sensory systems, but unlike Kant, PRI doesn't preserve a realm of objective empirical knowledge about it.

## Mind and World

Traditional philosophical problems about how mind connects to world assume a fundamental separation that needs bridging. If pattern-recognition is genuinely one event that includes both sensation-patterns and word-patterns as internal aspects, this separation becomes a conceptual artifact rather than a real problem requiring solution.

The classic "problem of the external world" dissolves: there's no problem of how internal representations connect to external reality because sensations and words are both aspects of pattern-recognition events, not internal copies of external things.

**Toward a Formal Framework**: This connects to insights from my analysis of semantic patterns in language models, where reference operates as R(concept-word, object-word) - entirely internal linguistic operations rather than word-to-world connections. PRI extends this: reference operates between different aspects of pattern-constellations (sensation-patterns, action-patterns, word-patterns) without requiring external grounding.

We can distinguish two types of existence within pattern-constellations:

* **E (immediate existence)**: The direct, pre-linguistic presence of sensation-patterns and readiness-patterns
* **∃ (mediated existence)**: The linguistic-conceptual patterns that develop integrated with sensation-patterns

For example, in cat-recognition:

* E: immediate visual, tactile, emotional patterns being present
* ∃: word-patterns ("cat," "feline") as integrated aspects of the same constellation

Both types of existence are internal to pattern-recognition events - there's no E without ∃ (even pre-linguistic recognition has proto-conceptual structure) and no ∃ without E (linguistic patterns are grounded in embodied readiness).

**A Neo-Tarskian View**: Once Field's primitive reference problem is dissolved, Tarski's internal approach to reference becomes more viable. But rather than reference between expressions in formal languages, we have reference between aspects of lived pattern-constellations. Truth becomes internal coherence within these constellations rather than correspondence to external states of affairs.

[^1]: The 'if...then' loop seems fundamental in pattern-matching algorithms

[^2]: An effort may be involved if we don't recall _who the person is_, but that means we recognized something but we lost its 'label', the recognition part is still instantaneous. See also the example below.

[^3]: The 'instantaneous' claim is a phenomenological observation about the experienced character of recognition, not a claim about underlying neural processes, which may involve complex parallel computations below the threshold of awareness.

[^4]: There is abundant neurosciences literature documenting these claims, with Libet et al. (1983), Sato et al. (2024) and Pulvermüller & Fadiga (2010) being some of the most well known. The neurological evidence for PRI is a connected research field but it must be said our approach is and needs to stay philosophical: PRI has important consequences in the Philosophy of Language, Reference Theory and the way we understand LLMs and AI in general.

[^5]: This difference illuminates why LLMs can exhibit apparently immediate pattern-recognition. While LLMs use probabilistic mechanisms during response generation, their transformer architecture processes contextual information in parallel rather than through sequential search during the recognition phase. The way we use language in conversation (question/response) may involve similar pattern-constellation activation, where word patterns activate alongside action/feeling/sensorial patterns in integrated networks.
