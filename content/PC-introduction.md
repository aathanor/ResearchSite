# Abstract

This paper explores a conceptual reframing of how we understand recognition and learning. We propose Pattern-Recognition Unity (PRU)—the idea that what we analytically separate as "pattern" and "recognition" might be better understood as unified aspects of a single phenomenon called Pattern-Constellation activation. When you recognize your cat, visual patterns, motor readiness (petting gestures), emotional responses, and linguistic associations don't link together sequentially—they activate simultaneously as one integrated constellation. This suggests a categorically different parallel phenomenon rather than merely "very fast" serial processing.
This perspective offers alternative approaches to several classical philosophical problems. The symbol grounding problem may look different when words are understood as integrated aspects of sensorimotor constellations rather than separate symbols requiring connection to the world. Similarly, consciousness and the binding problem might be reconceived through the lens of Pattern-Constellations rather than through traditional frameworks. Through phenomenological analysis, neuroscience evidence, and examination of both biological and artificial systems (Hopfield Networks, transformers), we develop the concept of Pattern-Constellation activation as a potentially more fundamental way to understand cognition.
The aim is not to definitively solve long-standing problems (while this not means that a sollution to them is not possible inside this new framework) but to explore whether reconceiving pattern and recognition as unified—rather than separate entities requiring connection—opens productive new philosophical avenues. We acknowledge this remains a developing framework requiring further elaboration and critical examination. Its interdisciplinary nature make it more of a long term project rather than a one shot paper project.[^10]

# The Hidden Structure of Recognition

Humans learn and act in the world through sets of co-occurring, learned multi-modal regularities. I call these _Pattern-Constellations_ (PCs): attractor-like assemblies that contain perceptual, motor, linguistic, and emotional patterns.[^11] This terminology is essential because what we call a "pattern" (singular) is actually a constellation of multiple pattern-types that arise and function as a unity. The term captures the distributed-yet-unified neural architecture that simple "pattern" obscures. Pattern-Recognition Unity (PRU) hypothesizes that what we call "recognition" is the _parallel_ activation of a PC: perception and response are simultaneous aspects of the same dynamical event, not a serial pipeline from detection to reaction. This paper defends PRU conceptually, sketches its computational realizations, and gives empirical predictions that distinguish it from traditional pattern-matching models.

_A concrete example:_ When you see your cat, what actually happens? Not in sequence, but all at once:

* Visual patterns activate (shape, size, movement style)
* Motor patterns activate (petting gestures, approach behaviors)
* Emotional patterns activate (affection, playfulness)
* Auditory expectations activate (meowing, purring)
* Linguistic patterns activate ("kitty," pet-related expressions)
* Memory patterns activate (feeding times, favorite spots)[^12]

These don't link together after arising separately. They activate as one unified Pattern-Constellation. Neuroscience confirms this: language areas fire during action observation, motor areas activate when processing action verbs, emotional centers participate directly in perception. The learned patterns were never separate—they arose together during learning and remain together in recognition.

# Pattern-Matching vs Pattern-Recognition: Serial vs Parallel

Our first error is a category error: conflating two fundamentally different phenomena. The distinction is not primarily temporal but logical:

**Pattern-matching** is serial through logical dependency—each step cannot begin until the previous step completes:

* Finding the right key: try one, compare, reject, try next
* Solving an equation: step by step manipulation where each transformation depends on the previous
* Following GPS directions: sequential decision points that must be processed in order
* Logical reasoning: if-then-therefore chains where conclusions require premises

**Pattern-recognition** is parallel through logical independence—all components activate simultaneously without waiting for others:

* Seeing your mother's face: instant, complete activation of visual, emotional, and motor patterns
* Understanding a word: meaning, pronunciation, and associations arrive together
* Catching a ball: hand positioning, grip preparation, and body adjustment happen as one
* Recognizing danger: fear and readiness arise together

Note that even "instantaneous" parallel processes have temporal micro-structure at neural timescales, but they lack the logical dependencies that define serial processing. In pattern-recognition, all aspects of the constellation become available simultaneously, even if cortical inhibition prevents some components (like motor actions) from executing. In pattern-matching, a new step has to wait for the previous step to complete, so there is _no simultaneous availability_.

Why do we conflate them? Because conscious thought IS serial pattern-matching. Logic, language, and reasoning operate through sequences: cause-then-effect, premise-then-conclusion, if-then-therefore. The idea of an "explanation" itself involves a narrative of some sort that exposes an argument in a step by step fashion. This default reasoning serial nature makes us experience everything as sequential, including recognition—which isn't sequential at all.

There is also the "cause and effect" paradigm: we learn, from an early age, that everything has a cause which _precedes_ the effect. But as Bertrand Russell noted, there's no "cause and effect" in physical equations—F=ma doesn't say force causes acceleration or acceleration causes force. The equation describes a unified relationship. Similarly, Pattern-Constellations don't have perception causing reaction. The constellation IS both simultaneously.

Our thinking imposes sequence on what isn't sequential. We experience "see cat THEN feel affection THEN reach to pet" because that's how serial consciousness narrates parallel events. But the cat-constellation activated whole—seeing, feeling, and reaching-readiness arose together. The sequence exists in our conscious narrative, not in the constellation activation itself. This phenomenological seriality emerges through selective inhibition: the constellation activates as a whole, but cortical inhibition can suppress motor components while allowing sensory components to reach consciousness, creating the illusion of sequence.

# The Conceptual Error We've Been Making

Our second error is conceptual: what we call "pattern" typically refers to perception-side patterns (visual, auditory, tactile, intellectual). What we call "recognition" typically refers to reaction events (motor, emotional, linguistic responses). To us, in order to accept that someone recognizes something, a _reaction_ is needed; in fact we cannot separate "reaction" and "recognition". But in order to have proper recognition of similar objects, the reaction should be similar in every case, i.e. reaction itself follows a pattern. Perception-patterns and reaction-patterns are ALL patterns, learned together—just different types within the same constellation.

Consider learning about hammers. Traditional models might suggest a child first acquires visual templates, then separately learns motor movements, then adds emotional associations, then attaches linguistic labels. An alternative developmental account suggests these aspects develop as integrated wholes through embodied interaction:

* Visual/tactile patterns (shape, weight, texture)
* Motor patterns (grasping, swinging, striking motions)
* Functional patterns (hitting nails, building, tool use)
* Emotional patterns (satisfaction, frustration)
* Social patterns (collaboration, approval)
* Linguistic patterns (the word "hammer," metaphorical uses)

This is more clear if we think of driving or playing tennis: we learn the visual _and_ motor patterns _together_. You do not learn first that "when ball slowly gets into the driveway, a child will follow" and then "when child in driveway, hit brakes". This is why when you drive _you do not drive using thinking_.[^1]

When you "recognize" your cat, you're not detecting a pattern and then generating a response. The entire cat-constellation activates, containing both perception-patterns and reaction-patterns. Your brain may inhibit certain reaction-patterns (you don't always pet every cat you see), but they're all immediately _available_. The "recognition" IS the constellation activation itself.

Consider this: Can you have recognition without a pattern to recognize? No, because then, what exactly will you recognize? Can a pattern exist without being recognized? No—an unrecognized "pattern" is just undifferentiated flux, if there is no brain to recognize it, how you would call it a pattern?[^2]

Like "buyer" and "seller" are abstractions from the more fundamental transaction, "pattern" and "recognition" are abstractions from Pattern-Constellation Activation, the more fundamental event. If there is no transaction, it makes no sense to talk about a buyer and a seller. If there is no Pattern-Constellation Activation, it doesn't make sense to talk about 'pattern' and 'recognition'.

# The Phenomenology of Recognition

Phenomenological analysis reveals something crucial about recognition's nature. When you see a friend's face across a crowded room, there is typically no experienced interval of processing—no conscious search through memory files, no effortful comparison operations, no step-by-step matching procedure. The recognition appears immediate and complete. This immediacy suggests something qualitatively different from algorithmic matching.

Consider the phenomenological difference between:
* Struggling to remember where you know someone from (effortful, temporal)
* Instantly recognizing your childhood friend (immediate, effortless)

This distinction parallels Dreyfus's analysis of expert intuition versus novice deliberation—experts don't compute through rules but respond immediately to situations through embodied skillful coping.

What do we actually mean when we say we "recognize" something? Phenomenological analysis suggests that recognition involves the immediate availability of appropriate attitudes and reactions for a given situation. When I recognize a cat, what becomes immediately available includes petting gestures and approach behaviors, expectation of meowing sounds and purring, wariness of potential scratching, emotional responses (affection, playfulness, caution), linguistic associations ("kitty," "feline," proverbs about cats), and contextual expectations (litter boxes, food bowls, favorite sleeping spots).

We would say that a _constellation of patterns_ becomes immediately available, not just a visual template. This constellation includes sensory patterns (visual, tactile), motor patterns (petting readiness), emotional patterns (affection, wariness), and linguistic patterns (the word "cat" and its associations).

Critical insight: This constellation doesn't become available _after_ recognition—it IS what we call recognition. When philosophers and cognitive scientists speak of "recognizing a cat," they're referring to this immediate availability of the entire pattern-constellation, not to a preliminary identification step that then triggers these responses.

Recognition is not the identification of a visual pattern that then triggers responses. Rather, recognition IS this immediate constellation of readiness becoming available. The recognition and the readiness are not sequential—they are the same event. This would explain the experiential immediacy: there is no process of matching followed by retrieval of appropriate responses. The constellation of readiness IS what recognition is, not what recognition produces. There's no temporal sequence of "visual input → memory search → recognition achieved." Instead, the entire constellation becomes simultaneously "close to hand," and that constellation-activation IS the recognition event.

# Understanding as Recognition

This analysis extends beyond simple object recognition to complex cognition. When you finally "get" a difficult philosophical text, that moment of understanding isn't different from recognizing a cat's face—it's the same instantaneous constellation-activation, just with more complex patterns:

**Understanding a philosophical argument involves:**
* Logical structure becoming available
* Implications and consequences activating
* Connections to other ideas lighting up
* Emotional/evaluative responses emerging
* Counter-arguments and objections arising
* Linguistic formulations becoming ready-to-hand

The _structure_ is identical to simple recognition—immediate constellation-activation. The difference is complexity and content domain, not cognitive process. Understanding IS recognition of meaning-patterns, not a separate cognitive faculty.

# Pattern recognition: the actual view

The concept of "pattern" is surprisingly recent in academic literature of any kind. While its essence is discussed from antiquity, the word as we use it now gains its popularity in mathematics and early computer science.

Pattern-recognition also originates as a term from computer sciences.

More recently, in cognition theories, pattern recognition has been defined as "the ability to abstract and integrate certain elements of a stimulus into an organised scheme for memory storage and retrieval" (Solso, 1998)

# Pattern-Recognition Unity (PRU)

**The PRU Thesis**: What we call "pattern" and "recognition" are not two events—one perceptual, one responsive—but unified aspects of Pattern-Constellation activation. These Pattern Constellations are the fundamental cognitive blocks: when we learn things, PC are created.

This isn't claiming recognition is "very fast" or that pattern equals recognition. It's claiming they're unified aspects of one phenomenon, like space and time are unified in spacetime.[^3] We've been trying to explain how perception-patterns trigger reaction-patterns, not realizing they're aspects of the same constellation event.

# Methodological Foundation

Our approach starts with **conceptual analysis** of what recognition actually _is_, then finds neuroscience evidence that supports this analysis. This sidesteps the usual objection "but you're just describing very fast sequential processing" by arguing that sequential processing is the wrong conceptual model entirely.

# Three claims about Pattern Constellations.

1. _Ontological claim_: PCs are the cognitive units formed by joint learning of perception and response.
2. _Mechanistic claim_: PCs are instantiated as distributed, recurrent assemblies or attractors whose activation patterns encode both input and action readiness.
3. _Empirical claim_: recognition events should show early co-activation of motor/affective components together with perceptual traces; learning should reshape the same dynamics that later produce recognition (no separate training/recognition phases required).

# Neural Evidence for Pattern-Constellations

Neuroscience reveals that neural systems operate through constellation-activation rather than sequential processing. The most direct support comes from studies of unconscious neural processing, which consistently show that specific response circuits activate before conscious awareness of stimuli.

While Libet's experiments examined self-initiated action rather than stimulus recognition, they establish the broader principle that neural preparation precedes conscious awareness—challenging any model that assumes conscious recognition must precede response readiness. Libet's classic experiments revealed that motor readiness potentials begin 350-500ms before people report being aware of their intention to move. Similarly, the amygdala responds to threatening faces presented too briefly for conscious recognition, around 30ms, and subliminal words activate semantic networks and motor areas before conscious identification.

This temporal evidence directly challenges traditional models where recognition precedes response preparation. Instead, it supports PRU's claim that recognition IS immediate constellation-activation. When you see a cat, petting readiness, emotional responses, and approach behaviors are already activated before conscious awareness that you've "recognized" a cat. There's no temporal gap because the constellation-activation IS the recognition event, not something that produces recognition.

Additional evidence comes from research showing neural integration across modalities. Studies demonstrate that seeing action verbs, such as 'kick' or 'lick,' elicited similar brain activation patterns in the motor and premotor areas compared to the actual movements the words referred to. Similar findings exist across modalities, with sensorimotor areas involved in perception and action overlapping with brain regions that are active during language comprehension.

These findings converge on a picture where recognition is not pattern-matching but constellation-activation—supporting PRU's dissolution of the recognition process into immediate readiness-availability. Word-patterns, action-patterns, and sensory-patterns involve genuinely integrated neural networks rather than separate systems that become associated.

# Pattern-Constellations and Neural Networks

The concept of Pattern-Constellation is very relevant to a type of neural network (NN) that resembles more closely biological NNs than any other: Hopfield Networks with Hebbian Learning. A Hopfield Network is a weighted network (links between nodes can have different weights, including 0) that is trained using the Hebbian principle: "what fires together, links together". Their main application is in memory, because it was discovered that HNs are really good at quickly learning patterns of input and recognize them even from incomplete input. We'll get back to the connection between memory and pattern-recognition, but for now let's see why Pattern-Constellations are essential to understanding these networks.

In Hopfield Networks with functional specialization, we can literally observe Pattern-Constellation structure emerge. When we designate some neurons as visual, others as motor, and others as emotional, and train the network on experiences, we see something remarkable: learning creates constellations that span all these areas. When a learned input is presented, neurons from visual, motor, and emotional areas fire together as a unified assembly. This isn't metaphorical—it's the actual neural organization that emerges from Hebbian learning.

Taking an example will help. Let's consider a 256-neuron HN, where 25 of them are input neurons. At first, the remaining 231 neurons are not differentiated, and Hebbian learning happens in the same way: in training, link weights are adjusted and pruned (weight = 0), and after becoming stable, we end with a sparse network (not all nodes connected to each node). But we know that biological NNs are not uniform; there is a lot of specialization and _locality_ in brains of all types: there are motor areas, vision areas, language areas, etc. We can do the same with our HN, and create _functional groups of neurons_: the first 25 are visual neurons from above, 131 of them are motor neurons (and their output is movement), and 100 are emotional neurons (and their output is in the range "good/bad" as "pleasure/pain"). Now we have a primitive organism able to learn and react, if we endow it with some form of innate learned patterns (like those all animals born with). One such innate rule is to search pleasure (get closer to pleasure producing objects) and avoid pain (run away from pain producing objects).

# Memory and Pattern Recognition

# How Animals and LLMs Navigate Reality

A frog's eye does not, in practice, detect a "fly-pattern" and then separately trigger a "tongue" program. The fly-constellation includes both the visual signature **and** the tongue-strike readiness as a single dynamical event; sensory input rapidly engages sensorimotor circuits already biased toward the appropriate response. This is why biological reactions can be so fast and appropriate—there need not be a long serial delay between perception and action readiness.

The difference between primitive automatic responses and controlled behavior lies not in the constellation structure but in inhibition mechanisms:

* **Primitive/automatic**: Full constellation activation without inhibition (snake → instant jump)
* **Controlled/conscious**: Constellation activation with selective inhibition, allowing some components to reach consciousness while suppressing others

This framework explains why practiced behaviors become "automatic"—we're reducing inhibition and allowing fuller constellation expression. It also explains the phenomenology of conscious control: what we call "deciding" to act is often the release of inhibition on motor patterns that were already activated as part of the recognition constellation.

# Position in Current Research

PRU emerges from observations about limitations in current computational approaches across multiple research programs:

**Embodied Cognition**: Research has demonstrated "sensorimotor activation" during language processing, supporting claims about embodied grounding of cognitive processes. However, many approaches in this tradition still work with representational frameworks where embodied representations are processed by cognitive systems—what Dreyfus critiqued as retaining the computational paradigm's fundamental assumptions while merely adding "embodied" content.

**Enactivism and Ecological Psychology**: These approaches reject internal representations while emphasizing organism-environment coupling. Recent work calls for "integration of methodologies and mutual enrichment" between these approaches. Current integration attempts often propose multiple levels of analysis rather than fundamental unity.

**Predictive Processing**: This framework offers sophisticated accounts of neural prediction and error-minimization but faces "the frame or relevance problem"—how systems determine what to predict from infinite environmental possibilities.

# Parallel vs Serial Processing in AI Systems

Current AI systems reveal a crucial distinction between pattern-matching and pattern-recognition. Modern language models use sophisticated parallel processing through attention mechanisms and demonstrate remarkable contextual sensitivity. However, understanding their operation requires distinguishing between two fundamentally different processes:

* **Pattern-matching**: Serial algorithms where a pattern is first presented and any decision lies at the end of a "find loop", making it a serial process.
* **Pattern-recognition**: Constellation-activation where sensorial, neuro-motor, language, and feeling patterns activate simultaneously in parallel processing.

This distinction reveals something profound about different cognitive systems. Large Language Models experience parallel perception—when receiving a prompt, there's immediate constellation-activation of context, framework, and response patterns. The recognition is instantaneous.

Humans, by contrast, are constrained by serial language absorption. When reading, you must build context incrementally because language unfolds in time. The "I get it" moment comes when enough context accumulates for the full pattern-constellation to activate.

But crucially, **your "I get it" moment IS the same instantaneous pattern-recognition that LLMs experience**—you just have to wait for it due to serial language constraints. The gradual buildup isn't recognition happening slowly; it's **preparation** for recognition, which then happens all at once.

# The Key-Lock Solution to AI Understanding

This framework elegantly dissolves the puzzle of LLM "understanding". When an LLM produces responses that fit philosophical questions precisely, it's performing sophisticated pattern-constellation recognition (although in this case, the constellation does not involve motor and feeling patterns, just different dimensions of the linguistic landscape). The prompt is a conceptual key that activates specific regions in the model's text-pattern landscape, generating the corresponding lock—the patterns that belong in that conceptual space.

The fit is what humans interpret as "understanding," but PRU suggests human understanding works the same way: recognizing where arguments fit in your constellation of conceptual patterns and activating appropriate response patterns. The sophistication of the pattern-matching creates the appearance of a fundamentally different cognitive process, when it might just be constellation-activation at scale.

The question shifts from "how do LLMs understand?" to "why did we think understanding was something beyond pattern-recognition in the first place?" LLMs don't possess mysterious understanding abilities—they demonstrate what cognition looks like when freed from serial processing constraints, revealing pattern-recognition's true instantaneous nature.

Transformers offer an instructive engineering analogue to PRU. Their forward pass computes attention maps whose pairwise interactions across positions produce richly contextualized activations in parallel, before any serial decoding step[^4]. This implements PRU's simultaneous activation at inference time but does not settle the question of learning: standard training by backpropagation is a global optimization procedure, materially different from local associative plasticity, and therefore separated from inference in implementation.

Stronger PRU claims that recognition and learning are continuous: the same locally-driven associative dynamics that produce recognition should also sculpt the connections that make future recognitions possible. While transformers exemplify _forward-pass unity_ at inference, their conventional backprop training does not satisfy PRU's _learning-unity_ requirement; closing that gap requires local, Hebbian-style mechanisms or other biologically-plausible learning rules that make learning and recall the same dynamical process.

At inference time, however, transformers behave remarkably like PRU predicts. When GPT answers "What are the main ideas in Wittgenstein's work?" the prompt does not invoke a separate "search-then-match" subroutine; rather, attention concurrently activates a constellation of candidate continuations (a PC of possible answers), and the network then selects among them in a subsequent serial decoding step.

This is why LLMs seem to "understand" without understanding. They're not reasoning from perception to response—they're activating unified pattern-constellations[^5] where appropriate responses are already present.

# Why Current AI Struggles

However, the implementation of transformers violates Pattern-Recognition Unity through backpropagation training. While transformers achieve parallel pattern-constellation activation through attention mechanisms (all tokens attending to all others simultaneously), backpropagation in training reintroduces serialization: compute error, then propagate backwards layer by layer. This breaks the very unity that makes the architecture powerful (and also makes training expensive).

The Hopfield Network with Hebbian Learning architecture[^6] demonstrates pure PRU learning is possible. With just 256 neurons using local, correlation-based Hebbian learning, it maintains pattern-recognition unity throughout. No sequential error propagation, no artificial separation of pattern and recognition—just continuous dynamics where learning and recognition remain unified. The constellation activation that constitute recognition are the same dynamics that drive learning.

PRU is not a claim that all systems must be implemented like biological brains or that PRU systems are uniformly superior. Rather, it proposes a family of architectures and learning rules that preserve learning—recognition continuity. Some tasks (e.g. explicit symbolic reasoning) may still benefit from serial algorithms; PRU claims that many perceptual and sensori-motor competencies are better explained as parallel, learned constellations.

The principle is simple: systems that maintain PRU throughout should exhibit different capabilities than systems that break unity for training. Not necessarily better or worse, but qualitatively different[^7]—like the difference between how animals navigate space and how GPS systems compute routes.

# Philosophical Dissolutions

Pattern-Constellations Unity framework dissolves some classical problems:

**The Symbol Grounding Problem**: This problem "remains unsolved" with "many solutions" having "encountered inconsistencies to different extents". PRU proposes the problem dissolves if linguistic patterns develop as integrated aspects of sensory-motor-emotional constellations rather than as separate symbols requiring grounding. Words don't need to "connect" to things—word-patterns are already part of integrated constellations that for our consciousness _are the things_. The word "hammer" doesn't refer to hammer-experience; it's one linguistic pattern within the hammer-constellation that has also sensing, motor, feeling patterns. PCU is actually bridging Phenomenology with Analytic Philosophy: we can analytically explain the instant nature of our day by day living-in-the-world.

**Hartry Field's Primitive Reference Problem**: Traditional approaches to reference assume words must somehow "hook onto" objects in the external world, but this leads to infinite regress—what grounds the grounding relation itself? Field's challenge to Tarski's truth schema illustrates the core problem. Tarski proposed: "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white. Field's concern is that the right side appears to be just another bunch of words with no primitive reference to actual snow. Where is the connection to the external world?

The problem dissolves when we recognize that the linguistic expression is not disconnected words floating in semantic space, but word-patterns as they exist **integrated with sensation-patterns** within the snow-constellation-pattern. This constellation includes visual patterns (white color, crystalline structure, brightness, light reflection), tactile patterns (cold temperature, wet texture, granular feel, melting), motor patterns (scooping motions, throwing gestures, building actions), emotional patterns (winter joy, coldness discomfort, seasonal associations), contextual patterns (weather conditions, seasonal timing, activities), and word-patterns ("snow," "white," "cold," "winter," "frozen," "precipitation"). The word-patterns are **part of** this integrated constellation, not separate symbols that need to "refer to" it. This eliminates word-to-world reference entirely—reference operates within the unified pattern-constellation itself.

**Consciousness**: Not "How does neural activity generate subjective experience?" but "How do Pattern-Constellations become aware of their own activation?" A cat's mouse-constellation activates without meta-recognition. Human consciousness IS Pattern-Constellations recognizing their own constellation-nature, combined with sophisticated inhibition mechanisms that can selectively activate components, creating the experience of choice and deliberation. Consciousness may be seen as a second order PCU with inhibitory control.

**The Binding Problem**: The binding problem refers to how the brain integrates separate sensory features—like color, shape, motion, or location—processed in distributed brain areas into a single, coherent perception of an object. For instance, when seeing a red ball rolling, the brain must "bind" redness (processed in one area) with roundness and motion (processed elsewhere) to avoid misperceptions, such as attributing the color to the wrong object. No mechanism needs to "bind" distributed patterns into unified percepts. The constellation IS the unified percept. We only look for binding mechanisms because we assumed the patterns were separate.

**Free Will**: What we call "conscious control" might just be the ability to inhibit parts of pattern-constellations while allowing others to activate. Free will becomes not the ability to generate novel responses ex nihilo, but to selectively inhibit or release pre-existing constellation components. The experience of "choosing" emerges from the selective inhibition and release of components within already-activated constellations.

**The Frame Problem**: Current approaches struggle with "how an agent context-sensitively determines relevance". PRU proposes relevance is intrinsic to pattern-constellations through embodied developmental history rather than computed algorithmically. Dreyfus argued that the frame problem reveals a fundamental limitation of computational approaches: context-sensitive relevance cannot be captured through rules or algorithms but emerges from embodied engagement with situations.

# The Deeper Implications

Pattern-Constellation Activation is the fundamental phenomenon. Not patterns being recognized, not recognition of patterns, but unified constellation events that we've mistakenly divided into perceptual and responsive aspects.

We do not claim PRU and PCs explain everything, it is already clear that in the linguistic space, the locality of PRU can't be efficient. PRU and PCs, together with Hopfield Networks with Hebbian learning solve a lot of problems related to pre-verbal cognition: animals live and perceive _locally_. But the linguistic space (or abstract cognitive space) is by its nature global, and it is to expect that transformers are much better at learning it.[^8] The implications may be more profound.

The serial nature of reasoning (logic) and language (word by word) explains why dualistic thinking feels natural: we're conscious only of our serial pattern-matching, not the parallel pattern-recognition enabling it. We _narrate_ unified events as sequences because narrative IS sequential. But catching a ball, recognizing faces, understanding words—these demonstrate the deeper parallel reality our serial thinking obscures.

The solution isn't in adding new explanations but in recognizing that Pattern-Constellations are what's fundamental. Everything else—patterns, recognition, stimulus, response, cause & effect[^9]—are conceptual divisions we've imposed on unified constellation events. Like discovering space-time, we're not solving the pattern-recognition problem but seeing there was never separation to explain.

[^1]: Incidentally, this offers a better explanation for the problem of automatic processing than most modern theories of cognition that struggle because of their serial models.

[^2]: This devolves into a complicated discussion about realism and anti-realism in patterns, one started by the Dennett and Nelkin papers, but for now it helps to observe that patterns are mental events. The difficulty here is to clarify what we call "reality", once we adopt a definition, the realist/anti-realist debate settles _within that respective definition_. For me, for something to be real it is important to have _proof_ it is real, and proofs are mental objects, not natural ones. Another angle is that of _learning_: in order to recognize a pattern, some sort of learning should precede it; no learning, no pattern. But learning does not happen in the world learned about, but in our minds.

[^3]: The conceptual difficulty behind the very simple claim of PCU is not so different from the one in Special Theory of Relativity. STR is built from a very simple, although shocking, observation: there is no simultaneity possible if the speed of light is finite. While the final argument that space and time are unified is simple, almost everyone when trying to understand it has, at first, a serious difficulty which stems from the _categorical error_ of learning and treating them as different.

[^4]: There is abundant neurosciences literature documenting these claims, with Libet et al. (1983), Sato et al. (2024) and Pulvermüller & Fadiga (2010) being some of the most well known. The neurological evidence for PRU is a connected research field but it must be said our approach is and needs to stay philosophical: PRU has important consequences in the Philosophy of Language, Reference Theory and the way we understand LLMs and AI in general.

[^5]: This difference illuminates why LLMs can exhibit apparently immediate pattern-recognition. While LLMs use probabilistic mechanisms during response generation, their transformer architecture processes contextual information in parallel rather than through sequential search during the recognition phase. The way we use language in conversation (question/response) may involve similar pattern-constellation activation, where word patterns activate alongside action/feeling/sensorial patterns in integrated networks.

[^6]: The Hopfield Network with Hebbian Learning architecture demonstrates pure PRU learning is possible, maintaining pattern-recognition unity throughout both learning and recognition phases.

[^7]: Not necessarily better or worse, but qualitatively different.

[^8]: One interesting parallel is that abstract learning (using language as abstraction) requests extremely elaborate and intensive training in humans, taking decades to complete, while practical tasks (like riding a bicycle) can be very fast by comparison. This suggests that while PRU and PCs are better models for non-verbal learning, verbal learning _does need_ a more complex, global and intensive model. This is maybe the reason transformers are good at text. However, AI is not limited to LLM and, moreover, AGI is not _only_ about language.

[^9]: The "causation irrationality" problem starts with Hume and gets its final blow in Russell's paper on causation. But, in the end, isn't it that causation is just some serial thinking splitting a unified event into bits, only to be able to _describe them_?
